# MyInventory AI

## Overview

MyInventory AI is an intelligent inventory management system that leverages AI-powered image recognition to catalog and manage household items. The application enables users to capture photos of items, automatically extract metadata through GPT-5 vision analysis, generate barcodes for tracking, and estimate resale values with confidence indicators. Items can be tagged with optional storage locations for better organization. Built as a full-stack web application, it combines a React-based frontend with an Express backend, persistent PostgreSQL storage, and integrates with OpenAI's API for image analysis capabilities. Features include advanced filtering with location badges, date ranges, professional PDF export, and barcode downloads.
